### Hi, I'm Boris

- ðŸ”­ I work on fun Machine Learning projects like [huggingtweets](https://github.com/borisdayma/huggingtweets).
- ðŸ‘¯ I love the open source ecosystem and frequently contribute to many projects
  - Machine learning tooling with [Weights & Biases]((https://docs.wandb.com/)
  - AI frameworks like [HuggingFace Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers), [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai), [Pytorch Lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning) and many othersâ€¦
  - anything I use that is public and that I can improve with a fix, a bug report or even just documentation
- ðŸŒ± I always like learning new stuff. Right now I'm into web development
  - [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) for front end
  - [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for design
  - [AWS Amplify](https://docs.amplify.aws/) for back end
- ðŸ¤« I currently work on a secret project but it's still too early to release

I always like meeting new people so please reach out!
