### Hi, I'm Boris

❤ I love AI and automation in general. I'm always trying to find new ways to improve industries, products or processes while benefiting society.

🤖 I make AI friendlier and more accessible through articles, improvement of tools/frameworks or just fun little projects like my tweet generator [huggingtweets](https://github.com/borisdayma/huggingtweets).

🙏 I love the open source ecosystem and frequently contribute to any project I use, especially in AI with [Weights & Biases](https://docs.wandb.com/), [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers), [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) and [Pytorch Lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning).

💡 I always like learning new stuff. Right now I'm into web development with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) for front end, [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for design and [AWS Amplify](https://docs.amplify.aws/) for back end.

🤫 I currently work on a secret project but it's still too early to release!

👋 I love meeting new people so feel free to reach out!
